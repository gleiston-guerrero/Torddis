abstract = {Advancing knowledge in educational technology requires a diverse array of research designs, methodologies, and data sources. Mixed methods research, particularly valuable for studying intricate issues, remains scarce in educational technology. The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence of mixed methods research studies published in the top 10 educational technology journals between 2018 and 2022. By examining n = 2380 articles from top educational technology journals, this study aims to enhance awareness of mixed methodologies among educational technology researchers, highlighting common approaches and identifying gaps. Adhering to best practices for prevalence studies and utilizing methods from evidence synthesis, three authors screened and coded articles for quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods, or non-empirical studies through three stages of data analysis. Results indicate that mixed methods research is underrepresented, constituting only 12% of all published articles, the smallest proportion compared to other types. Furthermore, 64% of these mixed methods studies did not self-identify as such despite employing mixed methods approaches, revealing a gap in methodological understanding. Among those that did self-identify, 68% failed to specify the type of core mixed methods approach used, indicating further gaps. The prevalence of mixed methods research published in the top 10 educational technology journals in a 5-year period ranged between 5% and 15% and is low compared to other types of published studies in the field. Addressing the underrepresentation and improving the specificity of methodological reporting can enhance the overall quality of research in educational technology.}
