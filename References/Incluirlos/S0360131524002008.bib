abstract = {Storytelling has been used for years in educational practice and Educational Robotics is a rapidly growing field worldwide. Accordingly, researchers have attempted to combine Storytelling and Robotics in education. However, no systematic record exists on this combination. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review of 82 papers out of 5272 articles published in 5 Databases in the last 20 years to map the conducted research so far. In detail: the educational levels and the school subjects in which storytelling and educational robotics are applied, the types of robots used, the duration, the sample size, participants' age and the skills that students may develop through this combination. Additionally, we analyzed, grouped, and presented the tools used for measuring the potential effects of storytelling and educational robotics. Finally, the students' role in the activities was sought. Based on our findings, most interventions mainly addressed preschool and primary school students, the robots used the most are humanoid, most interventions did not exceed 6 h, and the number of participants was less than 20 students. Besides, most interventions tried to develop students’ skills (communication, creativity, collaboration) and attitudes (engagement, motivation, participation) with qualitative tools borrowed from other domains (e.g. psychology, healthcare). This scoping demonstrates a gap in the use of storytelling and educational robotics in secondary and university education and subjects like history, geography, etc. Finally, this combination seems to have the potential to enhance the educational process, but more research is needed to shed light on all the aspects of the combination.}
