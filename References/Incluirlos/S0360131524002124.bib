abstract = {Help-seeking is an active learning strategy tied to self-regulated learning (SRL), where learners seek assistance when facing challenges. They may seek help from teachers, peers, intelligent tu-tor systems, and more recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, there is limited empirical research on how learners’ help-seeking process differs between generative AI and hu-man experts. To address this, we conducted a lab experiment with 38 university students tasked with essay writing and revising. The students were randomly divided into two groups: one seeking help from ChatGPT (AI Group) and the other from an experienced teacher (HE Group). To examine their help-seeking processes, we used a combination of statistical testing and process mining methods, analyzing multimodal data (e.g., trace data, eye-tracking data, and conversa-tional data). Our results indicated that the AI Group exhibited a nonlinear help-seeking process, such as skipping evaluation, differing significantly from the linear model observed in the HE Group which also aligned with classic help-seeking theory. Detailed analysis revealed that the AI Group asked more operational questions, showing pragmatic help-seeking activities, whereas the HE Group was more proactive in evaluating and processing received feedback. We discussed factors such as social pressure, metacognitive off-loading, and over-reliance on AI in these different help-seeking scenarios. More importantly, this study offers innovative insights and evidence, based on multimodal data, to better understand and scaffold learners learning with generative AI.}
