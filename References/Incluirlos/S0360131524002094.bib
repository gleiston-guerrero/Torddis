abstract = {Information and communication technology (ICT) have become indispensable in contemporary schools in post-industrialized countries. Whether schools have succeeded in vesting students with the needed digital skills important in today's highly digitalized societal landscape however remains unclear. In this paper, we examine whether school resources in terms of ICT infrastructure, use of ICT in education, and availability of technical expertise are pertinent to students' digital skillfulness. We also investigate whether such school ICT resources are unevenly distributed among students of different socioeconomic backgrounds, and whether students of different socioeconomic backgrounds unevenly benefit from these resources. In doing so, we illuminate school ICT resources' role in the process of intergenerational transmission of inequalities. To test our expectations, we employ ICILS 2018 data on 14,183 students in 751 schools across seven OECD countries. Our findings indicate that schools indeed play a meaningful role in nurturing digital skills, namely through students' use of ICT in educational tasks. We also find that students from more advantageous socioeconomic backgrounds more often attend well ICT-resourced schools, pointing at the uneven distribution of school ICT resources in a way that reflects social reproduction processes. Alongside that, the availability of technical expertise in schools seems particularly fruitful for low-SES students' digital skills development. This evinces that schools compensate for limited ICT skills socialization in the family, pointing at social mobility processes.}
