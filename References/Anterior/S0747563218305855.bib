abstract = {The present study proposes a new predictor of in-class smart phone multitasking, namely students' time perspectives (i.e., past negative, past positive, present fatalistic, present hedonistic, and future orientation, respectively), with problematic internet use as a potential mediator of these relations. Participants were 348 university students (62.9% females), self-assessing their time perspectives, generalized problematic internet use, and in-class smart phone multitasking, respectively. Results showed that problematic internet use fully mediated the positive relation between past negative and multitasking. It also partially mediated the negative relation between future orientation and multitasking. No significant mediation was found for the relations between either present hedonistic or present fatalistic, and multitasking. Still, present hedonistic proved to be a marginally significant positive predictor for students' in-class multitasking. Educational implications are discussed in terms of enhancing students' cognitive engagement in academic contexts, as well as increasing their self-regulated learning and awareness towards the detrimental effect of their in-class multitasking.}
