Torddis is an innovative system designed to mitigate the effects of parental absenteeism on academic performance by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The system monitors student distractions in real-time within home environments, detecting facial expressions indicative of distraction, unauthorised objects, and signs of drowsiness. Developed using the TDDM4IoTS methodology, Torddis integrates a mobile application with an IoT device to offer tutors a practical and efficient tool for supervising academic activities at home. Usability evaluations by tutors yielded a high System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 81.46\%, underscoring the system's effectiveness in enhancing student concentration and providing valuable insights for parents. While the system has demonstrated significant potential, recommendations for improving camera quality have been noted. Torddis aims to make a substantial impact on education, serving as a robust ally in the learning process and offering promising avenues for further technological advancements.
