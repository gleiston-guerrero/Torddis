Torddis, an innovative system developed to address the impact of parental absenteeism on academic performance, utilises Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Thongs (IoT) technologies to monitor studentsâ€™ distractions in real-time within their homes, identifying facial expressions of distraction, unauthorised objects, and signs of drowsiness. This technological solution, crafted following the TDDM4IoTS methodology, integrates a mobile application and an IoT device, providing tutors with an accessible and efficient tool for academic supervision of their students. The system's usability was positively evaluated by tutors, achieving a notable 81.46\% on the SUS (System Usability Scale: see Appendix \ref{Appendix:SUSQuestionarie}), emphasising its benefits for enhancing students' concentration and providing informative support to parents. Although its efficacy was acknowledged, improvements in camera quality were recommended. Torddis promises a significant impact on education, aiming to be a strong ally in learning and presenting opportunities for further development.
